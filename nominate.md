#### Things to consider before nomination:

* This is a **self-nomination** form, entries submitted on behalf of someone else will be deleted. This list is intended for individuals who have completed a PhD.

*  Please note that the self-identification categories are not perfect but are – as are all aspects of the directory – the result of discussion and compromise with input from many people from different constituencies. Please use the free response areas to clarify or add additional information about yourself.

* **This is a public directory. If you self-identify with any of the mentioned categories, you consent to making your self-identification part of your pubilic entry in this directory.**

* Not all listed identities/categories have legal protection in all locations.
